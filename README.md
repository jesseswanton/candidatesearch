# Github Candidate Search

## Description

This React application using the GitHub API will find random users on GitHub and display information about them so that you can add them to a list of potential candidates.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Add your [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) to an .env file in the root with the variable "VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN="
- Use npm run dev to start the application

## Usage

Upon loading the home page, following information will be diplayed:
- Avatar
- Username
- Name
- Location
- Company
- Bio
- Github Repository URL

Then you can add them to a list to review in the Potential Candidates page.
From there you can see the list that you've curated and remove them from the list if you would like.
